## A Blog 

***About***
This is my documentation and thoughts as I navigate the information security space. I have two years before a major (planned) move, in which I plan on entering the information security industry. 

Along the way I will be training, learning and networking with every spare minute I have. Currently completing a Masters of Cyber Security, and plan on getting OSCP, OSEP, CRTP, CRTE and any other certifications I can squeeze in. All this while juggling a full time job, and a family with 3 kids.
